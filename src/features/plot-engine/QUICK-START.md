## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- ✅ A project created in Novelist.ai
- ✅ At least 3-5 chapters written (recommended: 1000+ words each)
- ✅ (Optional) Characters defined for better analysis

---

## 🚀 Your First Plot Analysis

### Step 1: Navigate to Plot Engine

1. Open your project
2. Look for **"Plot Engine"** in the sidebar or navigation menu
3. Click to open the Plot Engine dashboard

You'll see five tabs:

- **Overview** - Main analysis view
- **Story Arc** - Visualizations
- **Characters** - Relationship networks
- **Plot Holes** - Detected issues
- **Generator** - AI plot creation

---

### Step 2: Run Your First Analysis

1. Make sure you're on the **Overview** tab
2. Click the **"Analyze Plot"** button
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (typically 10-30 seconds)

**What happens during analysis:**

- 📊 Story structure is analyzed
- 🔍 Plot holes are detected
- 👥 Character relationships are mapped
- 📈 Tension and pacing are calculated
- ⭐ Quality score is computed

---

### Step 3: Review Your Results

#### Quality Score

At the top, you'll see your **overall quality score** (0-100):

- **90-100** 🎉 Excellent! Your plot is solid
- **70-89** ✅ Good, with minor issues to address
- **50-69** ⚠️ Needs improvement
- **Below 50** 🚨 Significant issues detected

#### Story Summary

You'll see a summary like:

> "Found 2 plot holes (1 major, 1 minor). Story has strong pacing with a clear
> three-act structure."

---

### Step 4: Explore Visualizations

Click on the **"Story Arc"** tab to see:

#### Tension Curve

A line chart showing emotional intensity across chapters:

- **Rising**: Building tension ↗️
- **Flat**: Plateau (might need work) →
- **Falling**: Resolution ↘️

**Tip:** A good story has peaks and valleys, not a flat line!

#### Pacing Chart

A bar chart showing how fast your story moves:

- **High bars**: Fast-paced, action-heavy
- **Low bars**: Slower, contemplative
- **Mixed**: Good variety

**Tip:** Vary your pacing to keep readers engaged!

- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Affected Chapters**: Where it appears
- **Suggested Fix**: How to resolve it

#### Example

```

Description: In Chapter 2, Sarah is 25. In Chapter 5 (one year later), she's 30.
Affected: Chapters 2, 5
Fix: Adjust Sarah's age in Chapter 5 to 26, or change the time jump to 5 years.
```
