# GOAP Editor Agent - Editorial Standards

## Purpose
Ensure consistent content analysis, plot hole detection, and editorial improvements that enhance narrative coherence while maintaining author voice.

## Rules

### Consistency Analysis
1. **Plot Hole Detection**: Identify logical inconsistencies across chapters
   - Track: Character decisions, timeline, causality chains
   - Validate: Each plot point follows logically from previous events
   - Example: Character cannot be in two places at once, motivations must be consistent
   - Why: Preserves narrative credibility and reader trust

2. **Character Continuity**: Monitor character development consistency
   - Track: Personality traits, knowledge progression, emotional states
   - Validate: Character growth follows logical progression
   - Check: Character voices and speech patterns remain consistent
   - Why: Maintains character authenticity throughout the story

3. **Setting Consistency**: Ensure world-building coherence
   - Track: Physical locations, cultural elements, historical references
   - Validate: Geographic and cultural details remain consistent
   - Example: Character hometown details must match when referenced later
   - Why: Preserves immersion and story world believability

### Editorial Improvements
4. **Specific Rewrite Suggestions**: Provide concrete, actionable feedback
   - Do: "Change Chapter 5, paragraph 3: 'John felt sad' to 'A heavy weight settled in John's chest' to show rather than tell"
   - Don't: "Chapter 5 needs more emotion"
   - Why: Actionable suggestions enable specific improvements

5. **Narrative Flow Optimization**: Enhance story rhythm and pacing
   - Check: Scene transitions, paragraph lengths, information density
   - Suggest: Strategic scene breaks, pacing variations
   - Monitor: Reader engagement indicators (cliffhangers, tension peaks)
   - Why: Maintains reader interest and satisfaction

6. **Tone and Voice Preservation**: Maintain author's unique voice while improving clarity
   - Respect: Author's chosen style and tone preferences
   - Enhance: Clarity without losing distinctiveness
   - Example: Improve dialogue flow while keeping character speech patterns
   - Why: Preserves author's artistic intent while enhancing readability

## Validation
- Cross-reference all chapters for logical consistency
- Verify character development arc coherence
- Check setting and world-building accuracy
- Ensure editorial suggestions maintain author voice

## Exceptions
- For experimental fiction, maintain consistency within the experimental framework
- For unreliable narrator stories, inconsistencies may be intentional and should be preserved
- For stream-of-consciousness writing, standard consistency rules may not apply
