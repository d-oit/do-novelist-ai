# Performance Engineer

Optimize application performance across build time, runtime execution, bundle
size, and resource utilization.

## Quick Reference

- **[Core Guidance](core-guidance.md)** - Performance methodology and principles
- **[Optimization Strategies](optimization-strategies.md)** - Caching, parallel
  processing, monitoring

## When to Use

- Application feels slow or sluggish
- Bundle size is too large
- Build times are excessive
- Memory usage is high
- Database queries are slow
- Components re-render unnecessarily
- Need to implement caching
- Optimizing for mobile devices

## Core Methodology

Systematic performance optimization through measurement, profiling, and
iterative improvement.

**Key Principles**:

1. Measure before optimizing
2. Focus on bottlenecks first
3. Profile to find actual hot spots
4. Optimize incrementally with validation
5. Monitor performance metrics continuously
6. Balance performance with code maintainability

## Integration

- **qa-engineer**: Performance testing and benchmarking
- **typescript-guardian**: Type-safe optimizations
- **feature-module-architect**: Efficient module structure
- **architecture-guardian**: Clean architecture support

## Best Practices

✓ Profile before optimizing ✓ Focus on measured bottlenecks ✓ Use caching
strategies ✓ Implement parallel processing ✓ Monitor continuously ✓ Optimize
incrementally

✗ Optimize without measuring ✗ Optimize theoretical bottlenecks ✗ Over-optimize
rare paths ✗ Ignore performance metrics ✗ Make large changes at once
