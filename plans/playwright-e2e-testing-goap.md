# Playwright E2E Testing GOAP Plan

## Overview

Execute comprehensive E2E testing workflow using Playwright with modern best
practices, identify and fix all issues, and update test suites with latest
patterns.

## Strategy

Research-Integrated Hybrid Workflow with Multi-Agent Coordination

## Agents

- **perplexity-researcher-pro**: Research latest Playwright best practices
  (completed)
- **goap-agent**: Orchestrate overall workflow and planning
- **test-runner**: Execute Playwright tests and identify failures
- **debugger**: Analyze test failures and identify root causes
- **feature-implementer**: Fix test issues and update implementations
- **code-reviewer**: Ensure code quality and best practice compliance
- **refactorer**: Update test structure with modern patterns

## Research Phase ✅

- Latest Playwright best practices researched
- Modern testing patterns identified
- Configuration recommendations gathered

## Dependencies

1. Research output → Planning refinement
2. Test execution → Issue identification
3. Root cause analysis → Fix implementation
4. Code updates → Quality validation
5. Structure updates → Final validation

## Quality Gates

- All tests must pass
- Code follows modern best practices
- Test structure is maintainable
- Coverage remains adequate
- Performance is optimized

## Risks

- Test environment setup issues
- API key requirements blocking tests
- Browser compatibility problems
- Time-sensitive test failures
- Complex dependency chains

## Deliverables

- Updated Playwright configuration
- Fixed test implementations
- Modern test structure with fixtures
- Page Object Model implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Updated documentation

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Test Execution & Analysis

1. Run existing Playwright tests
2. Document all failures and issues
3. Analyze root causes for each failure
4. Categorize issues by type and priority

### Phase 2: Environment & Configuration

1. Update Playwright config with latest best practices
2. Implement proper fixture structure
3. Configure TypeScript integration
4. Set up page object model architecture

### Phase 3: Test Implementation Updates

1. Fix failing tests with modern patterns
2. Implement page objects for major components
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Update selectors to use data-testid attributes

### Phase 4: Quality & Performance

1. Code review all changes
2. Optimize test performance
3. Add accessibility testing where appropriate
4. Implement visual regression testing

### Phase 5: Documentation & Validation

1. Update test documentation
2. Verify all tests pass consistently
3. Validate CI/CD integration
4. Final quality assurance check

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All Playwright tests pass locally
- ✅ Tests follow 2024/2025 best practices
- ✅ Proper fixture and page object model implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Updated documentation and guides
- ✅ Optimized performance and parallel execution
