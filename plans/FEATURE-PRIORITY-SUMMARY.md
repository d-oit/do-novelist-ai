**Total: 5-6 months for full feature set (conditional)** **Start with Phase 1
Quick Wins - proven path!** 🚀

### Why Phased Approach Works:

✅ **Phase 0 Complete** - Lint fixed (0 errors), tests passing (462/462), build
successful ✅ **Phase 1 First** - Quick wins reduce risk, build team confidence
✅ **Rust Memory Validated** - 300-370 hrs, needs proof of concept ✅ **Decision
Gates** - Validate user demand before major investments ✅ **Same Database** -
Rust Memory uses Turso/libSQL (perfect match) ✅ **Unique Advantage** - Learning
system creates competitive moat

### Go/No-Go Decision Points:

- **End of Phase 1**: >80% gamification adoption? Proceed to Phase 2?
- **Mid Phase 2**: Team capacity for Rust? Build PoC?
- **End of Phase 2**: Full Rust Memory investment decision
