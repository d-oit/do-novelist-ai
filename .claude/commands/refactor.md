Refactor code to improve quality and maintainability.

Systematic refactoring while preserving functionality.

Usage: /refactor [what to refactor]

Common scenarios:
- File too large (> 500 LOC)
- Duplicate code
- Complex function
- Poor error handling
- Performance optimization

Steps:
1. Ensure all tests pass (baseline)
2. Commit current state (safe point)
3. Plan refactoring approach
4. Make incremental changes
5. Run tests after each change
6. Verify improvement achieved
7. Update documentation if needed
8. Create clear commit message
9. Report changes made

Use the refactorer agent for this workflow.
